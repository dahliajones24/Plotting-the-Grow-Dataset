The Python software built visualises UK sensor position data well. Pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib.pyplot for graphics are imported first. A CSV file with sensor data and a UK map image are processed by the script. It checks for essential columns like 'Latitude', 'Longitude', and 'SensorType' after reading the data. The data is then filtered to include only UK-bound sensor sites. Visualisation relevance and correctness depend on this filtration. The script uses a scatter plot to clearly overlay these filtered sensor locations on the map. Custom plot parameters, including an explanatory title and a clean, axis-free presentation, produce a user-friendly sensor distribution map. The script handles errors including missing files, empty data sets, and wrong data formats, making it robust to data processing challenges. This functionality makes the tool accurate and dependable for data processing and spatial visualisation.
